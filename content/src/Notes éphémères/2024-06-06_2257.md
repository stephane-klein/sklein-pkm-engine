> This brings us to the heart of the innovation behind the wildly popular ChatGPT: it uses an enhancement of GPT3 that (besides having a lot more parameters), was explicitly fine-tuned on instructions (and dialogs more generally) -- this is referred to as [[instruction-fine-tuning]] or IFT for short. In addition to fine-tuning instructions/dialogs, the models behind ChatGPT (i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4) are further tuned to produce responses that align with human preferences (i.e. produce responses that are more helpful and safe), using a procedure called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF).
